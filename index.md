#Welcome!

OpenRefine (ex-Google Refine) is a powerful tool for working with messy data, 
cleaning it, transforming it from one format into another, extending it with 
web services, and linking it to databases like 
[Freebase](http://www.freebase.com/). 

Please note that since October 2nd, 2012, Google is not supporting actively 
this project which have been rebranded to OpenRefine. Project development,
 documentation and promotion is now fully supported by volunteers. Find out

Organized by recipes with hands on example, the book cover the following topics:
1. Import data in various formats
2. Explore datasets in a matter of seconds
3. Apply basic and advanced cell transformations
4. Deal with cells that contain multiple values
5. Create instantaneous links between datasets
6. Filter and partition your data easily with regular expressions
7. Use named-entity extraction on full-text fields to automatically identify topics
8. Perform advanced data operations with the General Refine Expression Language

## 3. Reconcile / Match

OpenRefine can be used to link and extend your dataset with various webservices. 
Some services like [Freebase](http://www.freebase.com/) also allow OpenRefine
 to update your cleaned data to the central database. A growing list of
 extension and plugin with sources is 
[available on the wiki](https://github.com/OpenRefine/OpenRefine/wiki/Reconcilable-Data-Sources).
