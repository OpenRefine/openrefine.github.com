OpenRefine (ex-Google Refine) is a powerful tool for working with messy data, 
cleaning it, transforming it from one format into another, extending it with 
web services, and linking it to databases like 
[Freebase](http://www.freebase.com/). 

Please note that since October 2nd, 2012, Google is not supporting actively 
this project which have been rebranded to OpenRefine. Project development,
 documentation and promotion is now fully supported by volunteers. Find out
 more about the
 [history of OpenRefine](http://googlerefine.blogspot.ca/2012/10/from-freebase-gridworks-to-google.html) 
and how you can [help the community](/OpenRefine/community).
