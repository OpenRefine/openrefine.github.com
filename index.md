OpenRefine (ex-Google Refine) is a powerful tool for working with messy data, 
cleaning it, transforming it from one format into another, extending it with 
web services, and linking it to databases like 
[Freebase](http://www.freebase.com/). 

Please note that since October 2nd, 2012, Google is not supporting actively 
this project which have been rebranded to OpenRefine. Project development,
 documentation and promotion is now fully supported by volunteers. Find out
 more about the
 [history of OpenRefine](http://googlerefine.blogspot.ca/2012/10/from-freebase-gridworks-to-google.html) 
and how you can [help the community](/OpenRefine/community).

## 3. Reconcile / Match

OpenRefine can be used to link and extend your dataset with various webservices. 
Some services like [Freebase](http://www.freebase.com/) also allow OpenRefine
 to update your cleaned data to the central database. A growing list of
 extension and plugin with sources is 
[available on the wiki](https://github.com/OpenRefine/OpenRefine/wiki/Reconcilable-Data-Sources).
